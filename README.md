### Introduction <a name="introduction"/>
This project is the first instance of me implementing JavaScript into a webpage alongside HTML and CSS. The importance of this is to show that I am able to implement the skills I have learnt in the HyperionDev DfE web development course into a functional website. The project is a basic collection of web pages that represents an online guitar store. With pages to "purchase" different types of guitars, leave comments, a contact section and a "save for later" page. 

### Installation <a name="installation"/>

### How to use <a name="howToUse"/>
Once you have copied the files into a file on your machine, you will be able to access the main index page in your browser and navigate between the connected pages from there.
